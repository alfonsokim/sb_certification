== EXERCISE 4 ==
Unit test for each application within Exercise 2 and 3.

I've created a TupleMaker to make generate test tuples.
In all the tests here I use 0 for both quantity and price, 
I will assume that you have tested a zillion times the functions for 
Max, Min, Average, and Last Value so I focus on testing that the 
applications fire tuples whenever are supposed to do so.

You can run the Test Suite AllTestRunner.java to call all unit tests in one step
